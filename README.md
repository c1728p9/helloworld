# helloworld

This is a simple hello world example that demonstrates development 
on a new platform with locally-linked modules.

Included are Windows .bat script examples.  Modify as needed, depending 
on the local modules you are using.

The scripts assume that you are inside this executable module named "helloworld"
and that you have several modules located on the same level as "helloworld" 
that you want to link locally.

1. execute link_out_all_modules.bat to jump out of helloworld, and into each module and link them into your local directory
2. execute link_in_modules.bat to link the modules from the local directory to your execurable module (helloworld)
